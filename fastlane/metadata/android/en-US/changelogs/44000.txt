- Fixed some accessibility issues
- Added SMS mode. This allows the app to work by reading sms directly instead of relying on notifications. You can choose between SMS mode and Notification mode at will.
- Added option to copy the code as not sensitive. Enabling this will make the copied text visible on screen.
